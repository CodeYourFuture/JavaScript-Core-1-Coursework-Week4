/*
    Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
    somewhere safe while they call home for help.

    Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

    To be safe, they need to land on the first unnamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5%.

    Write a function that finds the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5% and 23.5%

    Some string methods that might help you here are .replace() and .substring().
