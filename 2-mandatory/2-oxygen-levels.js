/*
    Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
    somewhere safe while they call home for help.

    Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

    To be safe, they need to land on the first unnamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5%.

    Write a function that finds the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5% and 23.5%

    Some string methods that might help you here are .replace() and .substring().
*/

function findSafeOxygenLevel(array) {
let arr2 = [];
arr2 = array.filter(x => x.substring(x.length-1) === "%" );

arr2 = arr2.map(function (el) {
  return el.replace(/\%/g, '');
});

 for (let el of arr2){
  if (Number(el) > 19.5 && Number(el) < 23.1){
    return el + "%";
  }
}
