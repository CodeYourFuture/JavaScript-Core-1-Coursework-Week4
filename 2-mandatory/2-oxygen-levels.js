/*
    Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
    somewhere safe while they call home for help.

    Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

    To be safe, they need to land on the first unnamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5%.

    Write a function that finds the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5% and 23.5%

    Some string methods that might help you here are .replace() and .substring().
*/

function findSafeOxygenLevel(arr) {
  let arr1 = arr.filter(elem => elem.includes('%'));// only elements with %
  let arr2 = arr1.map(elem => parseFloat(elem));// transform in numbers
  let arr3 = arr2.find(elem => elem > 19.5 && elem < 23.5);// look for interval of numbers
  if (arr3) {
    return `${arr3}%`;//get string with %
  } else {
    return undefined;//no element in interval
  }
