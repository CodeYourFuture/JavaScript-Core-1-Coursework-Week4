/*
    Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock
    somewhere safe while they call home for help.

    Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere.

    To be safe, they need to land on the first unnamed planet that has Oxygen levels between 19.5% and 23.5%.

    Write a function that finds the oxygen level of the first safe planet - Oxygen between 19.5% and 23.5%

    Some string methods that might help you here are .replace() and .substring().
*/

function findSafeOxygenLevel(oxygenLevels) {
  let safePlanet = oxygenLevels
    .map((ox) => Number(ox.substring(0, ox.length - 1))) //removes % from strings & turns strings into numbers
    .find((oxygen) => oxygen > 19.5 && oxygen < 23.5); //finds first safe planet
  return safePlanet === undefined ? undefined : safePlanet + "%"; // returns oxygen level on first safe planet or unidentified if no planet is safe
}
