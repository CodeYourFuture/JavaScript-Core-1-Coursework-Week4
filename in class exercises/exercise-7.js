// Remember this example from earlier?
// console.log([333, 44, 1111, 2].sort());
// By default, the sort method converts these values to strings before sorting, so this will output [1111, 2, 333, 44].
//However, we can also pass in a compare function to override this sorting behaviour, read about this here: Docs
// Can you use a compare function in the code above to sort these values numerically?

const compareNumbers = ()
